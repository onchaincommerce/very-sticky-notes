Below is an updated PRD to include group notes functionality on top of the basic “XMTP Sticky Notes” concept. Feel free to save this as a .md file. The document retains the original structure while highlighting changes/additions related to group notes.

XMTP Sticky Notes PRD (with Group Notes)

Version: 1.1
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Author: [Your Name]

1. Overview

XMTP Sticky Notes is a lightweight, private note-taking and sharing application that leverages XMTP (Extensible Message Transport Protocol) for end-to-end encrypted messaging. Instead of minting NFTs, users “message themselves” to store private notes. Additionally, users can create group notes shared privately with multiple addresses, still using XMTP for encryption and storage. The dApp is built using OnchainKit for wallet connections and providers.

1.1 Objectives
	1.	Personal Notes: Provide a secure way for users to store private notes (visible only to themselves).
	2.	Group Notes: Enable users to share notes with multiple recipients in a private “group,” ensuring only those invited addresses can view them.
	3.	OnchainKit Integration: Use npm create onchain for rapid scaffolding and wallet connection setup.
	4.	E2E Encryption with XMTP: Leverage XMTP’s encryption so all note data remains private, viewable only by permitted addresses.

1.2 Why XMTP for Sticky + Group Notes?
	•	Privacy: XMTP messages are end-to-end encrypted.
	•	No Gas Costs: XMTP usage does not require on-chain transactions.
	•	Scalability: Users can create personal notes or share them with groups without paying gas or deploying contracts.

2. User Stories
	1.	Connect Wallet
	•	As a user, I want to seamlessly connect my wallet with OnchainKit so I can authenticate and use XMTP.
	2.	Create a Personal Sticky Note
	•	As a user, I want to write a note for myself and store it so only I can see it.
	3.	View My Notes
	•	As a user, I want to retrieve all of my previously saved personal notes in a dashboard.
	4.	Create a Group Note
	•	As a user, I want to create a note and share it with multiple addresses (friends, teammates, etc.), so each recipient can see and reply (or at least view) in a private manner.
	5.	View Group Notes
	•	As a user who is part of a group note, I want to see the note content and any replies (if supported).
	6.	Delete or Archive Notes (Optional)
	•	As a user, I want to hide a note from my personal view without necessarily deleting it from XMTP (since XMTP does not truly delete messages).
	7.	Revisit Notes on Any Device
	•	As a user, I want to log in with my wallet from any device and still see my personal notes and group notes where I’m a participant.

3. Scope & Features

3.1 Personal Sticky Note UI
	•	Requirement: Provide a sticky-note-style editor for single-user notes.
	•	Requirement: When saved, the note is sent as an XMTP message to the user’s own wallet address (self-conversation).

3.2 Group Notes
	•	Requirement: The user can select multiple wallet addresses (e.g., [0x123..., 0xABC...]) to share a note with.
	•	Requirement: The note is then broadcasted to each participant in an E2EE manner.
	•	XMTP group support: Since XMTP currently focuses on 1:1 conversations, we may need to either:
	1.	Send the same note message individually to each address (creating separate 1:1 threads).
	2.	Or implement a group-like mechanism (if/when XMTP offers a group chat feature).
	•	Requirement: Each invited address should be able to fetch and view the note in their XMTP-enabled client or in our dApp’s UI.
	•	(Optional): If replies are needed, each participant can reply in their 1:1 conversation with the original sender or in a group chat if supported.

3.3 Wallet Integration (OnchainKit)
	•	Requirement: Initialize the project with npm create onchain.
	•	Requirement: Provide wallet connection, sign-in flow, and ensure the user can sign XMTP identity messages.

3.4 Notes Management
	•	Requirement: Dashboard to list:
	•	Personal notes (self-conversation).
	•	Group notes the user has created.
	•	Group notes the user has received (i.e., they are a participant).
	•	Requirement: Provide optional local “delete/archive” functionality, acknowledging XMTP messages persist on the network.

3.5 Security & Privacy
	•	Requirement: All note content remains E2EE via XMTP.
	•	Requirement: No plaintext or keys are stored server-side by the dApp.
	•	Requirement: Only the intended recipients (the wallet addresses specified for group notes) can decrypt and view the content.

4. Technical Architecture
	1.	Front End (React + OnchainKit)
	•	Renders the sticky-note editor (both personal and group versions).
	•	Handles wallet connection and XMTP client creation.
	2.	XMTP Client
	•	Personal Notes: Self conversation with the user’s own address.
	•	Group Notes:
	•	If XMTP does not have native group chat, the app broadcasts the note to each individual address in a separate 1:1 conversation.
	•	Each user can read that note from their private conversation with the sender.
	3.	Storage
	•	XMTP network is the primary storage for encrypted messages.
	•	The front end only fetches and decrypts messages for addresses the user’s wallet owns.

5. Dependencies & Integrations
	1.	OnchainKit
	•	For wallet connection, providers, and quick scaffolding (npm create onchain).
	2.	XMTP JavaScript SDK
	•	For sending and receiving end-to-end encrypted messages.
	•	Potentially extended to handle group chat if/when XMTP supports it (or use a multi-send approach).
	3.	React
	•	For building the user interface (sticky note creation, group selection, note display).

6. User Flow
	1.	User Opens the dApp
	•	Connects their wallet via OnchainKit.
	•	Signs a message to enable XMTP identity if not previously set up.
	2.	Create a Personal Note
	•	Click “New Note,” type content, and choose “Private to Me.”
	•	DApp sends the message to the user’s own XMTP address (self-conversation).
	3.	Create a Group Note
	•	Click “New Note,” type content, and select multiple addresses from a “Recipients” input field.
	•	The dApp sends the encrypted note to each recipient via separate XMTP messages or a single group thread (if supported).
	•	The note is also stored locally for the sender, tagged as “shared with [list of addresses].”
	4.	Recipients View the Note
	•	Each recipient sees the note in their “inbox” or a dedicated area in our dApp’s UI.
	•	They can read it because XMTP’s E2EE is tied to their private key.
	5.	Delete/Archive
	•	Optionally, the user can mark a note as hidden locally.
	•	The actual XMTP message persists in the network.

7. Success Metrics
	1.	Number of Notes Created
	•	Both personal and group.
	2.	Number of Group Notes
	•	Volume of shared notes and addresses included.
	3.	Active Users
	•	Users returning to read, write, or share notes over time.
	4.	User Satisfaction
	•	Qualitative feedback on the ease of use (especially for group note sharing).

Sprint 6: Launch & Iterations	- Production deployment- Potential advanced features (reply threads, search, mention tagging)	Wk 9+

9. Risks & Mitigations

Risk	Mitigation
XMTP Group Support	If XMTP doesn’t yet support group threads natively, send 1:1 messages to each recipient and unify them in the UI.
User Confusion over “Deleting”	Clarify in UI that “delete” only hides the note locally; XMTP messages persist.
Scalability	Large group distributions could mean multiple sends. Optimize UI to avoid performance lags.
Address Mistypes	Add address validation or ENS lookup to reduce errors.

10. Assumptions
	•	Users have or can create an XMTP identity (a one-time signature).
	•	OnchainKit supports the user’s preferred Ethereum wallet.
	•	Group messaging in XMTP is either supported natively in the future or handled by sending the note individually to each recipient.

11. Open Questions
	1.	Group Replies: Do we need a unified “group chat” interface where all can see each other’s replies, or is it okay if replies remain 1:1 with the sender?
	2.	Ownership vs. Access: If a participant no longer should see group notes, how do we revoke access? (XMTP messages can’t be unsent once delivered.)
	3.	Search & Organization: Should we implement search, tagging, or categorization for both personal and group notes?

End of Document

This updated PRD includes group-note requirements while still preserving the simplicity of personal XMTP sticky notes. Adjust details as needed based on XMTP’s feature set (1:1 vs. group conversations) and any new enhancements.
